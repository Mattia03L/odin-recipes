        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <p>
            <ol type="circles">
                <li>If you're using the tomatoes, smash them up into a sauce using a fork</li>
                <li>Crush the dried hot peppers</li>
                <li>While you prepare the sauce you want to fill a pot with water, put a big pinch of salt in it, cover it with the lid and bring it to a boiling temperature</li>
                <li>The ideal water-salt-pasta ratio is 10 grams of salt for every liter of water, 1 liter of water for every 100 grams of pasta</li>
                <li>Put some oil into a saucepan, then add a single peeled garlic clove and the crushed hot peppers</li>
                <li>When the clove starts turning slightly golden, add the tomato sauce and mix a bit</li>
                <li>Put the lid on and when it starts to boil, turn the heat to low and let it cook at for about 6 minutes</li>
                <li>Open the lid, taste, add salt as needed, then cover up with the lid and let it cook for another 6 minutes at very low heat</li>
                <li>When the sauce is almost done put the pasta into the boiling salted water pot, follow the cooktime written on its packaging</li>
                <li>Remember to stir the pasta inside the water a couple times during the cooking process, especially early on as the pieces would otherwise stick to each other</li>
                <li>Remove the garlic from the saucepan</li>
                <li>When the pasta is done, drain the water and put the pasta directly into the saucepan</li>
                <li>Stir it up and add a bit of pasta water if the sauce looks a bit too dry, then turn off the heat</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
