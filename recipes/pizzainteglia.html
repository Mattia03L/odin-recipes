        <p>Traditional pizza needs a traditional wood-fired oven to make, but with this recipe you can make pizza at home in a standard oven.
            <p>You only need basic ingredients and the pizza will probably taste even better than 90% of any pizza places near you.</p>
            <p>We will guide you through the preparations of a normal margherita pizza, but you can add any toppings you want before putting the tray inside the oven</p></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the dough
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Place in a bowl both the flour and the yeast, then add the water and start kneading barehanded</li>
                        <li>When you've obtained a homogeneous dough, add salt and start kneading again for it to be incorporated properly</li>
                        <li>Now add the extravirgin olive oil and knead until it gets completely absorbed</li>
                        <li>When the dough looks homogeneous cover it with a piece of cloth and let it rest for 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>After 15 minutes take it on a flat surface and start stretching it and folding it multiple times</li>
                        <li>After a couple dozens of foldings shape it into a sphere, and let it rest inside the bowl for another 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>Take it back to the flat surface and give it another couple dozens foldings, the more the merrier, you'll notice that the more you do it the less sticky it gets</li>
                        <li>Make sure to close it properly when shaping it back into a sphere</li>
                        <li>Place the dough ball back into the bowl and let it leaven inside the fridge for 24 hours</li>
                        <li>After 24 hours take it back to the flat surface and give it another couple dozens foldings</li>
                        <li>Shape it into a loaf and make sure to close it up properly</li>
                        <li>Take a big enough container and put some flour on it, place the loaf inside it and let it leave for another 3 hours at room temperature, until its size doubles</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Put some salt, basil and oil into the tomato sauce, mix thoroughly and let it rest for the flavors to adjust themselves</li>
                <li>Cut the mozzarella fiordilatte in half, then slice it down</li>
                <li>After 3 hours the dough should be ready, make sure to oil up for good the baking tray</li>
                <li>Place the dough inside the tray and very gently spread it moving your fingers downwards (you don't need it to cover the whole tray just yet)</li>
                <li>Add some oil on top and let it penetrate the small cavities</li>
                <li>Cover with another baking tray and let it rest for another hour</li>
                <li>After a hour add half of the tomato sauce on top of the dough</li>
                <li>Start spreading it again very gently using your fingers (downward movements) to make it cover the whole tray</li>
                <li>Add a tiny bit more oil on the surface and bake in the lower part of the (preheated) oven at 250° Celsius for 15 minutes</li>
                <li>Take the pizza outside the oven, add the remaining tomato sauce and the mozzarella slices (You can add other toppings here)</li>
                <li>Place the pizza in the central part of the oven at 230° Celsius for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Now (If you didn't add other toppings besides the sauce and mozzarella/cheese) take the pizza out and add the basil leaves and some olive oil</li>
            </ol>
